# dispy-client
A barebones Python Discord client, for bots!

[My Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/uV5y7RY)

At the moment this is a prototype, it will be buggy. I will be working on this a lot for the next week or so, and I hope to make it actually start looking like a real client.  

# Setup
1. Install the requirements, `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
2. Grab a PyQt4 wheel file from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyqt4).  
3. Put it in this folder, and do `pip install <wheel-file-name>`  
4. You're all done with setup, run main.py.
